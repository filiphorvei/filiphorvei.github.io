# Welcome to my new website!

Story? Sure! I just started studying Computer Science at the University of Oslo, giving me access to the "GitHub Students Pack", or something like that. That gave me a free .me-domain, which I had to use for something!

So here we are. This website is powered by [Markblog](github.com/olaven/markblog) created by the amazing [Olav Sundf√∏r](https://olaven.org).

It's really easy to use and I think it's a nice contrast to the 2020-approach to web development, where the browser is given a truckload of JS-files that have to be interpreted, instead of recieving a nice finished HTML-document. What happened to the web server doing the heavy lifting?

Am I going to use this frequently? Probably not, I've never been into blogging. Still, now there is a place for me to do it! Also a good opportunity to learn some CSS because this is *not* looking good right now...
