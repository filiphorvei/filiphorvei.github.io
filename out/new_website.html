<p>Story? Sure! I just started studying Computer Science at the University of Oslo, giving me access to the &quot;GitHub Students Pack&quot;, or something like that. That gave me a free .me-domain, which I had to use for something!</p>
<p>So here we are. This website is powered by <a href="https://github.com/olaven/markblog">Markblog</a> created by the amazing <a href="https://olaven.org">Olav Sundf√∏r</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really easy to use and I think it&#39;s a nice contrast to the 2020-approach to web development, where the browser is given a truckload of JS-files that have to be interpreted, instead of recieving a nice finished HTML-document. What happened to the web server doing the heavy lifting?</p>
<p>Am I going to use this frequently? Probably not, I&#39;ve never been into blogging. Still, now there is a place for me to do it! Also a good opportunity to learn some CSS because this is <em>not</em> looking good right now...</p>
